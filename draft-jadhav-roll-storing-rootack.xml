    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies a proactive distance-vector
            routing scheme designed for LLNs (Low Power and Lossy Networks).
            RPL enables the network to be formed as a DODAG and
            supports storing mode and non-storing mode of operations.
            Non-storing mode allows reduced memory resource usage on the nodes
            by allowing non-BR nodes to operate without managing a routing
            table and involves use of source routing by the Root to direct the
            traffic along a specific path. In storing mode of operation
            the routing happens on hop-by-hop basis and intermediate routers
            need to maintain routing tables.
        </t>
        <t>
            DAO messaging helps to install downstream routing paths in the
            DODAG. DAOs are generated on hop-by-hop basis. DAO may contain
            multiple RPL Control Options. The Target Option identifies the
            address prefix for which the route has to be installed and the
            corresponding Transit Information Option identifies the parameters
            (such as lifetime, freshness-counter, etc) for the target. The DAO
            base object contains the 'K' flag indicating that a DAO-ACK is
            sought by the sender. The DAO, DAO-ACK progresses on hop-by-hop
            basis all the way till Root. In non-storing MOP, the DAO from the
            target node is directly addressed to the Root and the Root responds
            with a DAO-ACK indicating path establishment status. However, in
            storing MOP, the DAO-ACK is immediately sent by the upstream parent.
            Thus in case of storing MOP, the target node cannot rely on DAO-ACK
            as an indication that the end to end (from the target node to Root)
            path has been established.
        </t>
        <t>
            This draft highlights various issues with RPL DAO-ACK handling in
            Storing MOP. The draft provides requirements to solve the issues
            and provides an updates to RFC6550 based on these requirements.

        <section title="End to End Path Establishment Indication">
            <t>
                Nodes need to know whether the end to end path till the Root
                has been established before they can initiate application
                traffic. In case of NS-MOP, the DAO is addressed to the Root
                from the Target node and the Root sends DAO-ACK directly
                addressed back to the target node. Thus in case of NS-MOP, the
                node can make use of this DAO-ACK as an indication whether the
                necessary routes have been installed.  However, in case of
                Storing MOP, the DAO/DAO-ACK signaling happens at every hop.

            </t>
            <t>
                Note that in Storing-MOP, the DAO/DAO-ACK signaling happens on
                hop-by-hop basis and a DelayDAO timer is used
                before intermediate 6LRs generate the DAO. This
                would mean that the DAO reaching the Root may take
                several seconds. The target node should not generate the
                application traffic unless the end to end path is established.
            </t>
            <t>
                Consider <xref target="sample_top"/>, when node D sends a DAO,
                the node B receives the DAO and instantly sends back DAO-ACK.
                Node B then subsequently generates the DAO with Target as Node
                D and sends it to node A. The DAO with Target as Node D may
                take time (since the DAO is scheduled with DelayDAO timer by
                every node) to finally reach the Root at which point the end to
                end path is established. There is no way for node D to know
                when the end to end path is established. This information is
                needed for node D to initiate its application traffic.
                Initiating application traffic prior to this might almost
                certainly lead to application packet retries causing congestion
                in the network.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Target node is unaware if it needs to retry the DAO">
            <t>
                It is possible that the intermediate 6LR goes down while
                attempting to generate DAO on behalf of the target node. In
                this case, the target node has no way of knowing to retry the
                DAO, in which case the route installation may not happen until
                the target node's DAO lifetime expires.
            </t>
            <t>
                Consider <xref target="sample_top"/>, assume that node A was
                generating DAO with Target node D and sending it to Root.
                Node A reboots before attempting to send DAO to Root. Node A
                has already sent DAO-ACK downstream to node B. In this case,
                the target node D is not aware that sending DAO has failed
                somewhere upstream. Note that as per RFC6550 upstream DAO is
                scheduled based on DelayDAO but DAO-ACK is sent
                instantaneously on DAO reception from downstream node.

        <section title="RPL node acting as router for RULs">
            <t>
                An RPL node may act as a router for RPL unware leaves as
                described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves'/>.
                Ideally an RPL node should start accepting RULs solicitation
                only after making sure that it has established itself in the
                network first. In Storing-MOP, there is no way to ascertain
                this.

    <section title="Root-ACK from Root">
        <t>
            The draft defines a way for the RPL Root to send the Root-ACK back
            directly addressed to the Target node. The Target node can receive
            the Root-ACK directly thus getting an indication that the end to end
            path till the Root has been successfully established. The Root-ACK
            uses the same syntax and message code as DAO-ACK. The only
            difference is that the Root-ACK is directly addressed to the Target
            node who owns the advertised prefix in the Target Option.

                The K flag indicates that the Root of the RPLInstance MUST send
                a Root-ACK directly to the target node.

        <section title="Root sends Root-ACK addressed to Target">
            <t>
                On receiving a DAO with Transit Information Option with 'K'
                flag set, the Root MUST respond with a Root-ACK immediately to
                the address extracted from the corresponding Target Option.
            </t>
            <t>
                The Root-ACK MUST contain the Transit Information Option with
                parameters copied from the DAO's Transit Information Option
                based on which this Root-ACK was generated. The PathSequence in
                the Transit Information Option helps the Target node to
                identify for which DAO it generated it has received the
                Root-ACK. The DAOSequence in the base Root-ACK(DAO-ACK) base
                object is ignored by the Target node.
